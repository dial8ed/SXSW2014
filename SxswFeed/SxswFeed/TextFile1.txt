I have a call on my restful endpoint that returns a blank object per item. We'd be using this to populate the events collection in my DB, and the endpoint is at the following address: http://pepdisnappi.cloudapp.net/PencilthisAPI/api/Event/?ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.
 
I'll let you know if you need an API key for anything, right now you don't.
 
Since you have no clue what a "localized datum" should be: its the title and description of an event, here's a sample that is fully populated. Also in the data model below I have added indices. I'm going to use these for keyword searching around events. :  
{
    "Data": [],
    "StartTime": 0,
    "Duration": 0,
    "Comments": [],
    "Attendees": [],
    "RecurringType": 0,
    "Url": "http://www.sxsw.com",
    "Location": {},
    "LocalizedDatum": {
        "Title": "SXSW",
        "Description": "South by Southwestey stuff"
    },
    "Security": { "Name": "", "MemberOf": 0, "ViewableBy": 0 }
    "ID": "880C378B-75C3-4AD3-97C7-1C1FAF3FAF31",
    "Indices": ["Awesome", "Cool", "Event"]
}
 
The only thing I think you need to change is to get that data into this format, populate a guid for each, and add search indices based off of descriptive content. 
 
Thanks for the quick response man, you're a wizard. Looks pretty close.




//    "Data": [],
        public object Data { get; set; }
        
        //    "StartTime": 0,
        public string StartTime { get; set; }
        
        //    "Duration": 0,
        public string Duration { get; set; }

        //    "Comments": [],
        public List<String> Comments { get; set; }

        //    "Attendees": [],
        public List<string> Attendees { get; set; }
